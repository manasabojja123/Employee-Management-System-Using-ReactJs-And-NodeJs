### Project Overview: Employee Management System

#### Objective
The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive Employee Management System using React and Node.js. This system will enable efficient management of employee data, providing functionality for creating, reading, updating, and deleting employee records.

#### Key Components
1. **Database Setup**:
   - **Technology**: MySQL
   - **Purpose**: To store employee data persistently.
   - **Task**: Set up a simple relational database to manage employee information.

2. **Frontend Development**:
   - **Technology**: React
   - **Purpose**: To provide an interactive user interface for managing employees.
   - **Task**: Develop a React application that includes all necessary logic for handling employee data operations.

3. **Backend Development**:
   - **Technology**: Node.js with Express.js framework
   - **Purpose**: To handle server-side logic and API endpoints.
   - **Task**: Create API endpoints to interact with the MySQL database, facilitating CRUD operations.

4. **Data Communication**:
   - **Technology**: Axios
   - **Purpose**: To send and receive employee data between the frontend and backend.
   - **Task**: Implement Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend API.

5. **Authentication**:
   - **Technology**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
   - **Purpose**: To secure the application and authenticate users.
   - **Task**: Create a custom JWT tokenizer for user authentication.

6. **Routing**:
   - **Technology**: Express Router
   - **Purpose**: To manage and serve different routes of the employee management system.
   - **Task**: Set up routing to handle different functionalities and endpoints.

7. **Data Security**:
   - **Technology**: Hash functions (e.g., bcrypt)
   - **Purpose**: To ensure the security and privacy of employee data.
   - **Task**: Implement hash functions to encrypt sensitive employee information.

#### Summary
By the end of this project, you will have a fully functional Employee Management System that integrates a React frontend with a Node.js backend, secured with JWT authentication and data encryption. This project will enhance your skills in full-stack development, database management, and application security.
